# Data Analysis for Global Temperature Change

Climate change has become a critical global issue, with profound implications for human life and survival. Understanding the patterns and causes of temperature fluctuations is essential to addressing this challenge.


## ðŸŒŸ Data Sources

- Temperature Change Dataset: A record of global and regional temperature variations over time.

- Flag Dataset: A reference dataset that provides country-level data for comparison

- CO2 Emissions (kt): Data on carbon dioxide emissions measured in kilotons, reflecting the environmental impact.

## ðŸ’­ Key Questions to Address

1. How has the global temperature changed over time, and how have individual countries been affected?

2. What are the trends in CO2 emissions worldwide?

3. Is there a correlation between changes in temperature and CO2 emissions?
